RNA-Seq profiles were made from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Yoruba HapMap individuals in Ibadan, Nigeriagenerated as part of the International HapMap project. RNA from each individual was sequenced on at least two lanes of a Illumina Genome Analyser 2.

This is the Yoruba dataset from limma wehi webpage

Scroll to the bottom of the webpase.
The data is orginally in a RData file format.
it contains a DGEList object, "y"

Please look at yoruba.R to see the code I used to convert DGEList into a long format.
